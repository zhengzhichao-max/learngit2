*                      FIFO Size Configuration in Device mode
*  
*  (i) Receive data FIFO size = RAM for setup packets + 
*                   OUT endpoint control information +
*                   data OUT packets + miscellaneous
*      Space = ONE 32-bits words
*     --> RAM for setup packets = 10 spaces
*        (n is the nbr of CTRL EPs the device core supports) 
*     --> OUT EP CTRL info      = 1 space
*        (one space for status information written to the FIFO along with each 
*        received packet)
*     --> data OUT packets      = (Largest Packet Size / 4) + 1 spaces 
*        (MINIMUM to receive packets)
*     --> OR data OUT packets  = at least 2*(Largest Packet Size / 4) + 1 spaces 
*        (if high-bandwidth EP is enabled or multiple isochronous EPs)
*     --> miscellaneous = 1 space per OUT EP
*        (one space for transfer complete status information also pushed to the 
*        FIFO with each endpoint's last packet)
*
*  (ii)MINIMUM RAM space required for each IN EP Tx FIFO = MAX packet size for 
*       that particular IN EP. More space allocated in the IN EP Tx FIFO results
*       in a better performance on the USB and can hide latencies on the AHB.
*
*  (iii) TXn min size = 16 words. (n  : Transmit FIFO index)
*   (iv) When a TxFIFO is not used, the Configuration should be as follows: 
*       case 1 :  n > m    and Txn is not used    (n,m  : Transmit FIFO indexes)
*       --> Txm can use the space allocated for Txn.
*       case2  :  n < m    and Txn is not used    (n,m  : Transmit FIFO indexes)
*       --> Txn should be configured with the minimum space of 16 words
*  (v) The FIFO is used optimally when used TxFIFOs are allocated in the top 
*       of the FIFO.Ex: use EP1 and EP2 as IN instead of EP1 and EP3 as IN ones.
